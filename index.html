       I've always wanted to like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim more than I ever have in practice---a problem I had with Oblivion as well, and one that I have with lots of RPGs (as well as MMOs like The Elder Scrolls Online.)

Skyrim is riddled with problems, of course, from bugs and glitches to uneven acting and quest design. But it's always been the lackluster combat that left me cold. And I hate that, because this is exactly the kind of game I dreamed about as a kid: Sprawling, epic, filled with secrets and quests and magical items, dark secrets and shadowy organizations.

And yet every time I play the game I quickly get bored, or find myself switching to something else with more engaging mechanics like Dark Souls. It wasn't until I started playing the game with my son that things really clicked for me.

Playing the game with a kid really opened my eyes to the magic of it, warts and all. Watching him sneak across an open plain because he spotted a giant and some woolly mammoths in the distance is hilarious, but also speaks to the game's visual storytelling strengths. Having him practice his reading by going through the dialogue options is a fun way to make the game even a little bit educational (he's six and has some confidence issues with reading, but read the word "honored" in Skyrim without batting an eye...)

The whole process that is Skyrim has become more fun. Leveling up is cause for celebration. Discovering a new location is an event. Finishing a quest is exciting. Just talking about what dialogue option we should pick is fun. The game has become transformed in a way I didn't think possible.
